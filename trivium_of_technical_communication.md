**The trivium of technical writing**

Code/Content/Diagrams

See the triangle: diagram/content/code

Not suggesting a curry-Howard correspondence but a meaningful continuum.

We are made for image recognition. The memory master leverage cognitive cathedrals to retain large amounts of information. Even some programming languages are introducing this correspondence: [https://ballerina.io/](https://ballerina.io/)

Authoring or writing as "development" and publication as "deployment"
