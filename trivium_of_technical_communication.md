**The Trivium of Technical Communication** :small\_red\_triangle: 

I have recently become convinced that the most effective communication or documentation is presented in three forms. Natural language, formal executable language, and visual diagram. Or to put in a more pithy way. Code, content, and diagram.  When considering the relationship between the three you can compare them to eyes, mouth, and hands. Now, I am not suggesting something as strong as a curry-Howard correspondence but a meaningful continuum between the three. 

Let's start with code and content. It's long been understood that code should be self-documenting. One way to do this is to include snippets of natural language within the codebase that get parsed differently in order to produce human-readable documentation. The relationship works the other way as well. Do you remember the last really good tech talk you saw and how the speaker interspersed small snippets of code into the slides to demonstrate the things that were being discussed? It is to say that the clearest and most precise content should be precise enough to be formally modeled to some extent.

Famous cryptographer Nick Szabo has even made a distinction between wet code and dry code. If I'm following [his thinking](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html) properly then a legal contract would be an example of wet code. It's written to be rigorous, precise and without ambiguity but it still is, strictly speaking natural language. So even here the distinction between code and content is shown to be a continuum and not binary. 

The distinction between code and content is even further being blurred by how effective we are becoming at generating content from code ([GPT-3](https://beta.openai.com/)) and how our content is becoming increasingly structured with rich data ([Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)). Even the structure and flow of [narrative writing](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), and not just internal data points, is being driven by formal/executable tools with things like [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Dungeon). 

Let's move on to the diagramming side of things. This may strike you as purely icing on the cake but I have seen over the years how much time is spent on creating architecture diagrams. 

Cognitive cathedrals. 

Visual recognition. 

We are made for image recognition. The memory master leverage cognitive cathedrals to retain large amounts of information. Even some programming languages are introducing this correspondence: [https://ballerina.io/](https://ballerina.io/)

The recent popularity of Mermaid is because it allows one to produce diagrams from text.

In working with them Software architects the past few years I notice how much time we spent on creating diagrams and this time wasn’t spent because it was required by some executive leadership it was because it was an invaluable source of explanation and understanding with peers and team. Even among non-programming areas diagrams are so important I just spent several days in a scaled agile framework training seminar and we repeatedly came back to the safe diagram as a starting point for understanding the entire system. One couldn’t overestimate the importance of the snail with the tumor effect on scrum as well. Diagram sorry kind of compression of understanding
