**Computronium Notes**

Story Artifacts:

Where | Narrow (Places):



*   The Building

    The building knew who you were. Many buildings had sophisticated AI engines but this building had something even more sophisticated. Prime could tell this because he was in the habit of casually probing and scrubbing expert systems. The [analytics] building knew your face and your comings and goings. Even if someone stole his key card and pin, the building would know. The tension between privacy and surveillance didn't exist in contract work. If you weren’t comfortable having your every keystroke logged and at least three cameras on you at every working moment, then they'd find a contractor who didn't mind. Prime needed his changeling mask, his start a new life mask. He would not make it one block if the police issued a public warrant. The subway cameras would tag him.

*   Mall/City Center - culture
*   Autonomous taxi's - car chase
*   Motorhome - mobile fortress
*   highway - 75 and skateboards
*   Work - remote/VR/AR/telepresence/holograms
*   AI lab
*   Moonbase -
*   Hotel - atm - taxi - low level ai's everywhere

Items:



*   The changeling mask. A small plain mask much like one that someone would find in a craft store. Unlike those masks, this one gave a trained user a means of traveling without detection through a society of nearly ubiquitous surveillance. 

Who | People (Characters):

Adam: 


    Unpredictable learning AI. The first experiment with quantum computronium.


        A cube with a basic LCD readout. Similar to the beeps that old computer biases have. Very low tech physical interface

Leviathan: 


    Predictable strategy military AI

Prime


        Prime is a hacker. He wears wrap around HUD glasses that change with the sunlight. Primes raised in Russia. Has an accent. Obsessed with finger activities. Held back from disappearing by a desire to help his friend, Brody. 


        “I grew up in a small town in Russia. Well, it's actually the hacking center of the world. It is not unusual to see exotic cars in this empty dust bin.”


        Prime almost always uses a keyboard. He can do a Rubik's cube with one hand. No joke. and types (something close to a world record). *Include animated gif for both feats. According to Prime, there is not enough data throughput for touch, voice, or gesture input. Sure, it's great when you need it but when you really need to communicate expressively, nothing beats textual input. Prime has something of a digit fixation aka doing stuff with his fingers.

Brody


        Brody is built like an Olympic gymnast. Between his alternate reality gaming, parkour, and Judo training, he's quite the specimen. Primes buddy, Brody, is a startup adrenaline junky who wears thick frame HUD glasses and spiffy clothes. He's addicted to memes and net culture. 


    Brody hilariously freaks out when he realizes he is really being targeted.


    Brody wants to win the game.

The Agent (Brigs)


        An agent is not simply a highly trained operator. An agent is a symbiosis of the best of man and human artificial intelligence. 


        Tradecraft Ink is a military-funded software company. They specialize in law enforcement and special ops expert systems. These software packages go by different names and serve different branches of the government. You have Tradecrafts first and best selling product: Officer Joe. Big brother Joe, what the cops nicknamed the system guided the officer in law enforcement best practices and data collection. After refining the product they released a similar product for the armed forces. This is where the official story ends. Hashtag 'national security'. TradeCraft ink also has a top-secret classified expert system. The Jenkins AI system is optimized for tactical analysis, JIT weapons training, and tradecraft. It is used by special ops, spies, and tactical operators. What's more, operators are conditioned to have involuntary physiological responses to key Jenkins commands. In this way, Jenkins can increase an operator's speed and strength almost two-fold. The Jenkins combat companion is exactly that. The operator's companion. It comes with utilities like a one-time pad. The body of specific methodology for intelligence analysis is generally referred to as analytic tradecraft.[6] The academic disciplines examining the art and science of intelligence analysis are most routinely referred to as "Intelligence Studies. Black bag operations (or black bag jobs) are covert or clandestine surreptitious entries into structures to obtain information for human intelligence operations.[1] This usually entails breaking and entering into denied areas. Some of the tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with black bag operations are lock picking, safe cracking, key impressions, fingerprinting, photography, electronic surveillance (including audio and video surveillance), mail manipulation (flaps and seals), forgery, and a host of other related skills. The term "black bag" refers to the little black bag in which burglars carry their tools.[2]

Where | broad (The world):


    Augmented reality everywhere. All advertisements are dynamic.


    The web is everywhere and it's visual. It's all powered by ads that are simply dynamic ads over real ads in real life. your glasses know what you look like so that visual impression, someone paid for. The internet of things is upon us. Everything is connected to the internet and everything is managed by special intelligence bots. This is a story from bots to ai. bots are everywhere in society but Adam is different from the other bots. they can be hacked, Chris knew that.


    Much like phones and computers have become synonymous in 2020, so glasses and AR have become synonymous in this time. 


    Chris put on his glasses (review accelerando and rainbows end description of ar glasses) and the world jumped into life. A near-perfect overlay sprang to life in his vision. The only difference between the world and the overlay was that the net was more vivid. don't like the color of that sofa? change it. Don't like seeing the kitchen in the restaurant? remove it altogether. express yourself with net fashion. the nicer the shades and close, the nicer the affect.


    Most of the interactions in the system were mediated by the OS through verbal conversation. One could also touch type or carry a keyboard if you were a real nerd.


    Imagine rouge bot-nets that DDOS for hire. DDOS DAO’s. Gay marriage and polygamy have already been embraced by the culture. Intimate relations between real and virtual entities are growing rapidly. Human/machine marriage is becoming an increasingly hot topic. There is one famous advocate of human/machine marriage that got taken for everything by a Russian bride con bot. Thought she had something wonderful until all her finances disappeared two years into the "relationship".

Historical Notes:

The chess bot Deep blue made a mistake that mr casperove interpreted as a higher intelligence move and then totally sent him off the rails.. [historical factoid]

AlphaGo and move 37

RFC:

The Flash crash caused by one man.

Kaminsky hole

“An unexpected consequence of Frege’s work was the discovery of weaknesses in the foundations of mathematics. For example, Euclid’s Elements — considered the gold standard of logical rigor for thousands of years — turned out to be full of logical mistakes. Because Euclid used ordinary words like “line” and “point,” he — and centuries of readers — deceived themselves into making assumptions about sentences that contained those words. To give one relatively simple example, in ordinary usage, the word “line” implies that if you are given three distinct points on a line, one point must be between the other two. But when you define “line” using formal logic, it turns out “between-ness” also needs to be defined—something Euclid overlooked. Formal logic makes gaps like this easy to spot.” - [Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/)

The story formula:

1 - a mismatched pair of partners

2 - with real philosophical differences

3 - go on a wacky adventure

4 - someone or something of value is lost

5 - the partners learn unique lessons

6 - there's a cool musical piece

7 - there's a wacky group of supporting characters

8 - the hidden world of everyday objects is explored

9 - the main characters find their calling

10 - an ad hoc community is formed by the end of the movie

Story Tips:

- plays against type

- give characters secrets

- get them in trouble

- make them proactive

- change the main character

Character development notes:

- What do they want and what is standing in their way? If you can't answer that, then you don't have a character.

- If you get stuck, put your character through hell.
