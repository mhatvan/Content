# Project vs Feature Thinking

What are the differences?

- A project assumes a conclusion and is temporary in nature.
- Features are persistent areas of functionality of an application.

What are the consequences of these definitions? 

- Firstly, it should cause pause that scrum teams are always called feature teams, not project teams. 
- It assumes a feature is “done”. But we are never really “done”; we are only ever at further stages of maturity. 
- It assumes someone else will take care of maintenance and support. If a feature is done, then that team would logically move on to another project. 

Conclusion: long-lived features, not projects
